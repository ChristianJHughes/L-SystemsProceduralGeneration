# L-Systems Procedural Generation Tool

<b>[L-Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system)</b> provide a wonderful tool for procedurally generating patterned structures. They are particularly good at generating dynamic foilage and landscaping.

Games benefit greatly from L-Systems -- developers can use tools like this to create many unique structures, without going through the laborious process of creating each asset individually. The tool allows for easy export of an <b>[SVG](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG)</b> asset.

Games are fun! This tool is not. Use this tool to make fun games!
